# CoderDojo Twin Cities mBot Concept Cards

When our CoderDojo students enter our "robots" classroom they generally see three areas:

1. Beginners - for first time students that have not used robots before
2. Intermediate - for students that have done the mBot lessons and are ready to move on to the MicroPython robots
3. Advanced - advanced students using the [AI Racing League Cars]

Each of these areas have a set of colorful laminated cards that have three colors:

    1. Beginning Green Cards - for first time students that have not done any lessons before
    2. Intermediate Blue Cards - for intermediate students that have finished the green Labs
    3. Advanced Black Cards - for students that have mastered all the intermediate concepts
