# mBot vs mBot2

In June of 2021 mBlock introduced the new mBot Neo, also known as the mBot2. This new robot had many new features, but also a higher price point.  Since we can teach most of the principals of computational thinking using the mBot we don't think there is a real compelling reason to upgrade unless you also want to teach advanced MicroPython.
